📉 Customer Churn Analysis – R Data Analytics Project
This project analyzes customer churn data from a telecom company to identify key factors contributing to customer attrition. Completed entirely in R as part of my portfolio development, the analysis provides data-driven business recommendations to reduce churn and improve customer retention.

🧾 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains customer-level information, including:

Demographics (gender, senior citizen status, tenure)

Services used (internet, phone, streaming)

Billing details (monthly charges, contract type, payment method)

Target variable: Churn (Yes/No)

📁 Data Source: Kaggle - Telco Customer Churn

🛠️ Tools & Packages Used
R Language

tidyverse – data cleaning and manipulation

ggplot2 – data visualization

dplyr – group-wise summarization

lubridate – date handling

(Optional) caret – predictive modeling

🔍 Workflow Summary
Data Cleaning

Handled missing values and incorrect data types

Transformed categorical variables into factors

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized churn rate across contract types and services

Examined relationships between churn and tenure, charges, and add-on services

Insights and Interpretation

Identified patterns in churn behavior

Performed group-wise summaries and visual storytelling

(Optional) Predictive Modeling

Built a logistic regression model to classify churn risk

Evaluated model accuracy (Confusion matrix, AUC)

📊 Key Insights
Short-tenure customers have significantly higher churn rates

Month-to-month contracts are the most vulnerable to churn

Add-ons like Online Security and Tech Support are associated with lower churn

Customers with higher monthly charges are more likely to leave unless on long-term plans

💡 Business Recommendations
Provide discounts or loyalty programs for customers in their first 6 months

Encourage upgrades to longer-term contracts through targeted offers

Bundle value-added services (e.g., online security) to improve retention

📁 Files Included
customer_churn_analysis.Rmd – Main R Markdown notebook with full analysis

customer_churn_cleaned.csv – (Optional) Cleaned data used for analysis

churn_visuals/ – Folder containing exported plots (PNG format)
